## PeTTa

Efficient MeTTa language implementation in Prolog.

Please check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/patham9/PeTTa/wiki) for more information.

### Dependencies

- SWI-Prolog >= 9.3.x
- Python 3.x (for janus Python interop)

### Usage

Example run:

`time sh run.sh ./examples/nars_tuffy.metta`

### MORK and FAISS spaces

If MORK and FAISS is installed, execute `sh build.sh` to support MORK-based atom spaces and FAISS-based atom-vector spaces.

The following projects are cloned and built by build.sh:

**Repository:** [mork_ffi](https://github.com/patham9/mork_ffi) dependent on [trueagi-io/mork](https://github.com/trueagi-io/mork)

**Repository:** [faiss_ffi](https://github.com/patham9/faiss_ffi) dependent on [facebookresearch/faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)

### Extension libraries

Please check out [Extension libraries](https://github.com/trueagi-io/PeTTa/wiki/Extension-libraries) for a set of extension libraries that can be invoked from MeTTa files directly from the git repository.

## Notebooks, Servers, Browser

### Jupyter Notebook Support

A Jupyter kernel for PeTTa is available in a separate repository for interactive MeTTa development in notebooks.

**Repository:** [trueagi-io/jupyter-petta-kernel](https://github.com/trueagi-io/jupyter-petta-kernel)

Quick install:

```bash
# Set PETTA_PATH to this PeTTa installation
export PETTA_PATH=/path/to/PeTTa

# Clone and install the kernel
git clone https://github.com/trueagi-io/jupyter-petta-kernel.git
cd jupyter-petta-kernel
./install.sh
```

Please see the [jupyter-petta-kernel README](https://github.com/trueagi-io/jupyter-petta-kernel/blob/main/README.md) for detailed installation instructions and usage.

### MeTTa server

A HTTP server running MeTTa code is also available:

**Repository:** [MettaWamJam](https://github.com/trueagi-io/MettaWamJam)

Please see the [MettaWamJam README](https://github.com/trueagi-io/MettaWamJam/blob/main/README.md) for detailed installation instructions and usage.

### MeTTa in WASM

Since Swi-Prolog can be compiled to Web Assembly, one can embed PeTTa into websites.

Please see [Execution-in-browser](https://github.com/patham9/PeTTa/wiki/Execution-in-browser) for more information.
